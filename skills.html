    <h1 class="text-center p-4 text-decoration-underline">Skills</h1>
    <p class="text-center w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center">The following are skills I have acquired over time, whether that means through jobs I have worked at, or experiences
    within my education.</p>
    <h3 class="text-center w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center">General Skills</h3>
    <div class="h-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">

        <ul class="pt-2 col-6 align-items-center p-4 border rounded-4 border-dark-subtle border-2">
            <li class="fs-4">Time Management</li>
            <p class="w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center">In my time working as a produce associate at Walmart, I had
            to practice time management by making an efficient use of my time when stocking the sales floor, as we would
            often have time constraints before other tasks that would need to be completed soon after. This meant
            planning ahead when deciding what tasks to do, and in what order, to make sure that they all got done, and
            as efficiently as possible. I also practiced this skill throughout my education, between projects, deadlines,
            and scheduling, I had to find the best ways to manage any time I had available to work on assignments and/or
            projects.</p>
            <li class="fs-4 ">Customer Service</li>
            <p class="w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center">Throughout both of my jobs, I have had extensive experience
            with helping customers, and making their experience as pleasant as possible. While working as a produce
            associate at Walmart, I would assist customers by guiding them to where they could find a specific product,
            or helping them pick the best quality produce. As a lot porter for Titus-Will Toyota, I check customers in
            for their service appointments, and patiently listen to their concerns regarding their vehicles, so I can accurately
            guide them to the correct department of service.</p>
            <li class="fs-4">Teamwork</li>
            <p class="w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center">I have had extensive experience throughout my life working
            with teams, as I thrive in a team environment. While working at Walmart, there was never a time when we
            didn't need to coordinate with our team to make sure we were stocking the sales floor efficiently and
            properly. We spent time in daily huddles, going over what we were accomplishing, and what may have needed
            work, in order to improve our productivity as much as possible every day. At Titus-Will Toyota, we work as
            a team to make sure all the tasks are completed, without making customers wait any longer than necessary.
            This meant coordinating on who was working on what task, to ensure the most efficient use of our time, and
            the shortest wait time for customers possible. I have also had plenty of experience with teamwork throughout
            my education, with some of the most recent examples being, working on team projects in my software development
            courses, where it is absolutely necessary to coordinate with a team to make sure that tasks and goals are
            distributed fairly, and frequent meetings to ensure that everyone is on-track. This is extremely relevant to
            my future career, as it gives very similar experiences to working with a team in the professional software
            development field.</p>
            <li class="fs-4">Multitasking</li>
            <p class="w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center" >Working as a lot porter at Titus-Will Toyota has given me
            a great deal of experience with multitasking, as it is a necessary trait within the job, balancing between
            checking customers in, bringing cars to the mechanics, and washing/vacuuming cars before returning them to
            the customers. Often times, we don't have enough staff to allocate someone to each of these tasks, so many
            times we need to multitask and split our attention between multiple tasks. I have also had experience
            multitasking in my education. Some more recent examples of this would be listening to a lecture in class,
            while simultaneously working on applying the same concepts hands-on in a program, to gain a better
            understanding of how the concepts work, and to ensure I fully understand how to implement these concepts in
            a real environment.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center">Software Development Related Skills</h3>
    <div class="h-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
        <ul class="pt-2 col-6 align-items-center p-4 border rounded-4 border-dark-subtle border-2">
            <li class="fs-4">Java</li>
            <p class="w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center">Java is the programming language that I am most experienced
            with. Taking my first courses on Java during high school, I have made significant progress in learning Java.
            From writing my first "Hello World!" program, to making a space invaders styled game. I am continuing to
            learn more about programming in Java as I complete my Bachelor's Degree in Software Development.</p>
            <li class="fs-4 ">HTML/CSS</li>
            <p class="w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center">Although I am still relatively inexperience with HTML and
            CSS, I feel that I have made promising headway. I have become fairly confident in creating and styling
            websites, along with incorporating interactive aspects, which also relates to JavaScript</p>
            <li class="fs-4">JavaScript</li>
            <p class="w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center">This is another skill that I am not very experience with,
            but I feel that I am making significant progress towards being proficient with it. From form validation to
            interactive features on websites, I have only had around 6 months of experience with JavaScript, but I feel
            that it may be one of my favorite parts of web development, as it can really make the biggest difference
            between a website that feels outdated and hard to look at, and a website that feels modern and sleek.
            </p>
            <li class="fs-4">Software Development</li>
            <p class="w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center" >Software Development as a concept is something I find
            fascinating, and I enjoy getting into the details of the software development life cycle, and learning what
            the most efficient ways of developing software are. This is something I have been learning since day one of
            my software development education, in high school, and I continue to learn new concepts and information
            related to software development as time goes on.</p>
            <li class="fs-4">Bootstrap</li>
            <p class="w-100 pt-2 col-6  align-items-center" >This is my least experienced skill, but I am picking up on
            it very quickly, matter of fact, this entire website is styled using mostly bootstrap. I find it incredibly
            helpful in styling pages, as CSS can occasionally be unclear or inconsistent. Bootstrap enables me to style
            pages much faster, and keep more consistent styling between pages and other elements withing web pages.</p>
